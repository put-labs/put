# PUT SDK

Use the PUT SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [PUT Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/put-program) instead.

More information about PUT is available in the [PUT documentation](https://docs.put.com/).

The [PUT Program Library](https://github.com/put-labs/put-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
