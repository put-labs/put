# PUT Program

Use the PUT Program Crate to write on-chain programs in Rust.  If writing client-side applications, use the [PUT SDK Crate](https://crates.io/crates/put-sdk) instead.

More information about PUT is available in the [PUT documentation](https://docs.put.com/).

[Helloworld](https://github.com/put-labs/example-helloworld) and the [PUT Program Library](https://github.com/put-labs/put-program-library) provide examples of how to use this crate.
